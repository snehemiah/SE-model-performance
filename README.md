# SE-model-performance

# Background
This project aimed to evaluate the performance of spatially-explicit statistical catch-at-age models (see: ) compared to spatially-implicit (fleets-as-areas) approaches. Using Atlantic Striped Bass, we developed a simulation study to assess accuracy of spatially-explicit multi-stock and spatially-implicit single stock assessment models with alternative scenarios of data availability and data quality. Specifically we evlauted the effect of ageing error and stock composition data on model accuracy.

 All models were developed in ADMB (https://www.admb-project.org/). 

# Model Descriptions
1. **FAA1**
2. **FAA2**
3. **SE1** - This model is a two spawning stock (Atlantic Coast and Chesapeake Bay), two area (Ocean and Chesapeake Bay) model that estimates abundance, movement, fishing mortality, and biomass at two 6-month time-steps for 30 years. This model does not assume error in the age composition data.  
4. **SE2** - Similar to SE1 except it assumes ageing error in the age composition and applies an ageing error matrix.  
5. **SE3** -

For a complete description of SE2, see()
